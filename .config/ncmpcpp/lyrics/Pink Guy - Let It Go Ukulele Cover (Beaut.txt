[Verse 1]
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen (Grunt)
My penis growing with a swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, I just want Olaf's cock inside

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just let him in, just let him see
Let Olaf see my naked body with his erect peen
Conceal and feel his magic carrot
Let him enter my ass
(AAAAAAAAHHHHH)

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Let it go in my ass (Please Olaf)
Let it go, let it go
Olaf let it go (In my ass!)
Eat my ass (AAAAAAAAHHHHH)
Eat my ass (Olaf fuck me!)
Eat my ass
Eat my ass
Let his cock rage on (Kill me, please!)
Let him penetrate me in any way
(Oh look, you've been impaled)

[Verse 2]
Slam me against the furniture (Crashing and screaming)
Choke me so I can't scream (Choking)
Melt in my ass like ice cream
Build your snow cock in my spleen (Grunt)
I scream so loud but the police can't hear my cries
(Crashing and screaming)
Olaf impales me with his huge creamy ass surprise
(Help! Help!)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My ass is tight, his smile is wider
Than my gaping asshole looking him straight in the eye
It hurts so much I want to die (Kill me! Kill me!)
But I do it for Olaf
(Oh, I've been impaled)

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Let it go in my ass
Let it go, let it go
Olaf let it go (Everybody, sing with me!)
Eat my ass (Eat my ass!)
Eat my ass (Olaf strangle me!)
Eat my ass (Olaf kill me, please!)
Eat my ass (Eat my ass)
Let his cock rage on
Let him penetrate me in any way
(AAAAAAAAHHHHH)
