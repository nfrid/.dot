(Ichi, Ni, San, Yon)

[Verse 1]
No, I can't escape this social stigma. Wuh-oh-oh!
This reputation at school
Na, I don't get club invitations
No, Cause they don't want this fool! Ho-oo~

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why don't I make my own club
Where I can do what I love?
I'll spend my time just writing songs
And singing all day long!

[Chorus]
We never know where this life might take us
So I - *pant* get excited when there's a change in plan
No, we don't know when this life might take us away
So Imma make it worth my stay

Babada-ba-babadaba-ba-ba~ (yeah)

[Verse 2]
So I made my way down to the office. Wuh-oh-oh!
To, then, officialize my club
But there was already one like it
To which they signed me up for, against my will

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I walked into the club room
Four girls were staring at me
Oh no, I'm pretty sure that
This is one of those idol groups

[Chorus]
We never know where this life might take us
So I - *pant* get excited when there's a change in plan
No, we don't know when this life might take us away
So Imma make it worth my stay

Babada-ba-babadaba-ba-ba~ (yeah)

[Bridge]
I gotta get out
I don't belong
I tell myself to move along
I turned around and left the room

Then someone said "Wait!"
"Are you the fifth we're supposed to get?"
"Well, as a boy, you do not fit."
Oh no~ "But please do not quit." (Ooo~)

"This club needs five members."
"Or it will dissolve."
"We don't care what it take."
"The struggle makes us strong."
"We don't know what you're good at or where you belong."
"But how's about you be our manager and write our songs?"

[Chorus]
We never know where this life might take us
So I - *pant* get excited when there's a change in plan
No, we don't know when this life might take us away
So Imma make it worth my stay

Huu-uu-uu~ *pant* I get

[Outro]
No, we don't know when this life might take us away
So Imma make it worth my stay
